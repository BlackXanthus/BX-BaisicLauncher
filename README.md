# BX-Launcher
A simple Launcher. 

It's main functional code is currently based on: http://arnab.ch/blog/2013/08/how-to-write-custom-launcher-app-in-android/

It should be noted that you will need to view the main code of that particular website how-to to get it working.

Since then there have been some small changes. 

It is now possible to swipe horizontally, and vertically on the container, and see a simple message saying which direction you have swipped. This was part of an initial exploration to help understand fragments.

As Pager is part of the android development, this branch of the code is dead, but left here to help other weary travellers. See the main branch : BX-Launcher
