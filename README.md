# BX-Launcher
A simple Launcher. 

It's main functional code is currently based on: http://arnab.ch/blog/2013/08/how-to-write-custom-launcher-app-in-android/

It should be noted that you will need to view the main code of that particular website how-to to get it working.

Since then there have been some small changes. 

It is now possible to swipe horizontally, and vertically on the container, and see a simple message saying which direction you have swipped. This was part of an initial exploration to help understand fragments.

The next step will be to move to a Pager view.
